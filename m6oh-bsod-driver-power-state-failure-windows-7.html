                            <p>Well, title, basically. I was having issues with that particular BSOD at shutdown with my main keyboard, the K70 RGB. I noticed it acted funky (Caps/Num lock LEDs not lighting up when toggled, etc) and I swapped it out for my old, worn out Sidewinder X4 as a test. Interestingly, the BSODs have stopped. I really favor the mechanical K70 (went through the whole O-Ring labor of love) and would like to know what is going wrong. Since the Corsair driver program isn't the issue (or so says BlueScreenV. So i wiped my Hard Drive using a Linux Live CD and when i came to install windows 7 from a bootable USB (no disc drive) it got past the "Expanding Files" and when it would normally reboot, it showed up that BSOD along with the 0x9f error code. I have googled it and it says it's graphics card related but i dont have any OS on my HDD. Its wiped. So i took out my PCI Graphics card and tried it and it showed up the same error. Any ideas? Also i have managed to install Ubuntu I've already created a post for this issue a while back and the problem still persists. I've been in touch with Razer CS but unfortunately many attempts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful. After that I've returned the Razer Blade 15 unit 3 times already, which means, this is my 4th Razer Blade 15 (2018 Advanced Model) now. (I chose the 2018 model all over again because it was discounted and I don't feel the need for RTX graphics). Every single one of them had the exact same issue.

Hoping some of y'all can help me. I have a homebuilt PC that I upgraded to windows 10 about 3 months ago. I was using windows 7 up until that point.

Hi. amp#x200B; I recently got a new laptop and installed a copy of Windows 10 which I didn't activate, nor did I use any activator for MS Office, since I have a license for that one. I noticed a problem whenever I played GTA V and it crashed for random reasons, (i.e. activating something in a trainer), my laptop would stop responding and after a couple of seconds would display a BSOD with the DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE message. This started happening every time Illustrator crashed, Photo. 
Yo! I really need a hand over here. I'm so pissed of already with Windows 10 bullshit that I cannot clearly think of any solution. I built a PC some time ago (about 3 weeks). I decided to go with dual boot cause I hate windows and I use Linux, but for these games (why game devs are so f.ing stupid to not make games also for Linux?) work only with Win. So i install it too. With Linux I do not have any problems, but of course with Windows there are many. First, what was happening, sometimes. Is anyone having this problem? Just happened the other day. Only thing that has changed was I updated nvidia drivers. I rolled back drivers but it's still happening. windows 10, geforce 1080, 4790k. BSOD says "driver power state failure" Have tried every My PC keeps getting BSOD's after trying to export a video in Adobe Premiere CC 2019. The export will reach 100% and then my PC freezes for a few seconds and then gives me a blue screen. The stop codes I keep seeing are DPC_ WATCHDOG_VIOLATION and, more often, DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE. I've tried every fix I could find over the past month to no avail. This only happens when exporting a video. I can play games, watch videos, photo edit, etc. without any issues. My system is an MSI Gaming Noteboo. 
Im dual booting windows 10 + Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using grub. Windows 10 goes to bsod driver power state failure every 20 minutes or when i do something intensive like 7 tabs open on chrome  editing pdf etc. I tried changing power mode to Max performance. disabling wifi adapter ( thought its driver was making problem). Reinstalled windows 10 as well. If i game straight for 8 hours there is no bsod or anything. weird right?. Also my windows 10 dont have shutdown restart option in lockscre. Hey everyone, Specs: i7-9700k/EVGA 2080 Ti/32GB DDR4 RAM I have two issues that I think are related to one another. First. When I boot up my PC (the times that I do shut it down), Windows starts up in low resolution and I have to wait about 2 to 10 mins for my graphics drivers to kick into 4K. I'm not sure why this happens, but here's what I've done to troubleshoot: - Reinstalled NVidia drivers - Rolled back NVidia drivers - Updated MOBO BIOS None of these solved the issue at all. Second. Greetings, amp#x200B; So ive had this issue for a while now and don't know how to fix it. amp#x200B; Every time I use Photoshop, it causes BSOD. Noticed that it mostly happens while alt+Tab ing, but has happened while not alt+tabbing as well. amp#x200B; Everything went to hell when I updated my intel drivers to newer DCH drivers, Since then, ive Reinstalled windows, Photoshop, reset blade to its factory settings, Reinstalled both Nvidia and intel drivers with DDU, but nothing. TL;DR: laptop works fine if I use the generic windows video driver; if I install the nvidia one, every time my pc is not being used it BSODs. Longer version: I have recently bought a Santech G59 (based on clevo p7XXtm) that mounts an RTX 2060 and a G-sync 144hz FHD panel. First of all, I have problems while trying to installing the drivers for my card. The auto-detect feature always fails, and whatever driver I do download (either for 2060 desktop or mobile version) the install never. Model: Asus K75VJ Laptop (https://www.asus.com/Laptops/K75VJ/specifications/) CPU: Intel® Core™ i5 3210M Processor GPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 635M with 2GB DDR3 VRAM Issue: GPU/GPU driver commonly (But not always) crashes during high GPU load. Example: Launch game, GPU-Z software shows GPU load at 99%, Everything running on GPU crashes, GPU-Z shows no readings for GPU (https://imgur.com/m7SUGBQ), 5 minutes later BSOD for DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (https://imgur.com/BPVlxXC). Here is the hardware Lenovo Y50-70 i7-4720HQ 8GB RAM GTX 860M (render-only) 1TB hard drive So here is how the owner of the laptop, my sister, reported her issue to me. Her OS updated Feb 16, still on 1803 though. Feb 18 she was playing a game, then it crashed and froze the laptop. Next thing she knew all games were running very slowly. She was still able to use it, just not game on it. Feb 24 and I finally got my hands on it, turns out her GPU driver is not functioning well. So I've been trying to resolve a BSOD issue that randomly appears rarely out of nowhere and only recently I've finally opened up the DMP logs to find the issue. Seems like amd_sata.sys is causing the issue, however, I cannot seem to update the driver for it as the newer driver keeps popping up after the restart with the tool asking to repair or remove it. So I'm currently wondering what I should do to fix this issue? Specs : ASUS Sabertooth 990fx r2.0 - BIOS 2104(Going to try and update. 
I just purchased a Certified Refurbished Dell XPS 15 9570. From Day 1 it has been giving me BSOD with the message "DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE" This seems to be a wireless adapter issue my hints below Google Chrome (72.0.3626.121) DNS Resolution for a site will fail and 15-30 seconds later the BSOD appears. CMD Prompt ping/traceroute seems affected during that period I will turn on Mini Dumps, I haven't had time to configure Windows in the few days I have had it for better error. On 2/8 I purchased an XPS 9570, the next day I got a message that the CPU fan was not operating. I returned it, I looked into Precisions, and other machines and ultimately decided an XPS 9570 had all the features I wanted. I Purchased another one on the Outlet with the Premium Support and Accidental Damage Coverage, along with a TB16 and a U3419W. Between 2/23 and 3/5. Day one (within an hour) of opening the new 9570, it proceeded to BSOD "Driver Power State Failure" It proceeded Hey there!

I'm getting a BSOD with the Driver Power State Failure error in Windows 10. This is occurring after approximately 70 minuets of use (doesn't seam to be effected by what I am doing on the computer eg. Gaming, youtube, ect). I have looked at the minidump.

Hey, I have a problem that I can't fix after months trying, but i'm still getting regular BSOD. I've tried to uninstall/reinstall my drivers (with updated or older drivers); i've tried to reinstall windows; i've tested my RAM, cleaned registry errors, scan for system error etc. The only thing which worked was to uninstall the nvidia drivers (it's the GeForce MX150). For some weeks I did that and everything was fine, but yesterday I needed to use my graphic card again so I reinstalled I manage 200 laptops for a company. Over the past two weeks, we're getting hammered with a pernicious bug where our bluetooth cards stop working. This happens regardless of what kind of bluetooth card the laptop has, and regardless of which driver version. I've seen it happen on Dell XPS 13 9360s and 9370s, on both Killer Wireless and Intel WiFi cards. I believe it is a Windows bug where Windows is putting the bluetooth card to sleep and then never wakes it up again. Sympoms </p>
